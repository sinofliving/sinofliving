## BYF! 🦀

<p align="center"><i>“Living itself is the source of sin. As long as I can make them laugh, it doesn't matter how, I'll be alright. If I succeed in that, the human beings probably won't mind it too much if I remain outside their lives. The one thing I must avoid is becoming offensive in their eyes: I shall be nothing, the wind, the sky.”</i><br>— Osamu Dazai</p>

Pronouns: Any (I do not concern myself with whatever Gender people perceive me as.)     
Orientation: Aro-Ace. Never come to me with anything other than Platonic Feelings. I do not do Commitments.

### 💬 Notes
1. Please ask before C+H — friends are always welcome.
2. Copying my Ponytown Skins = block 🚫  
3. I am an ENTP, see that however you wish.

## 🦀 About Me!

I tend to stay up late quite often either conversing with Friends, watching some Horror Movie or Playing any of the Games mentioned below.       
A big dislike of mine: people who only come to unload their misery onto me, expecting i'll entertain it like a clown.

Leave behind a jest, a confession, or a riddle that even you don’t understand. In the end, it’s all the same, isn’t it?
