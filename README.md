## BYF! ♡

<p align="center"><i>“Living itself is the source of sin. As long as I can make them laugh, it doesn't matter how, I'll be alright. If I succeed in that, the human beings probably won't mind it too much if I remain outside their lives. The one thing I must avoid is becoming offensive in their eyes: I shall be nothing, the wind, the sky.”</i><br>— Osamu Dazai</p>

Pronouns: Any (I do not concern myself with whatever Gender people perceive me as.)     
Orientation: Aro-Ace. Never come to me with anything other than Platonic Feelings. I do not do Commitments.
