<p align="center"><i>“Living itself is the source of sin. As long as I can make them laugh, it doesn't matter how, I'll be alright. If I succeed in that, the human beings probably won't mind it too much if I remain outside their lives. The one thing I must avoid is becoming offensive in their eyes: I shall be nothing, the wind, the sky.”</i><br>— Osamu Dazai</p>

Pronouns: Any (I am Agender, therefore the choice of my Pronouns is entirely yours.)     
Orientation: Aro-Ace. Never come to me with anything other than Platonic Feelings. I do not do Commitments.

### 💬 Notes
1. Please ask before C+H — friends are always welcome.
2. Copying my Ponytown Skins = block 🚫  
3. I am an ENTP, therefore quite mischievous. (I may bully you, but only if we are close. My bullying or insulting is never meant to be taken serious.)

## 🦀 About Me
![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Osamu%20Dazai-Kin-brown?style=for-the-badge)

I tend to stay up late quite often either conversing with Friends, watching some Horror Movie or Playing any of the Games mentioned below.       
A big dislike of mine: people who only come to unload their misery onto me, expecting i'll entertain it like a clown.

### 🎮 Games I Enjoy
Roblox → SEWH, Evade, any type of Horror Games and random Stupid Obbies.   
VrChat → Mostly play Horror Games on there.   
CallofDuty → I only play the Campaigns because i love Military Games that have some Storylines in them.

### 💫 Fandoms
Bungou Stray Dogs, Call of Duty, FNAF, Undertale, Deltarune, NBC Hannibal, Deadpool and Wolverine, and more!

Osamu Dazai from Bungo Stray Dogs(highest kin unfortunately), Jax from The Amazing Digital Circus and Spamton from Deltarune.
